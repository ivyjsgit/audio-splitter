# Audio Splitter
## Usage
To use this program, you **must** have FFMPEG installed.

To run this program, you need to create a splits file.

A splits file will look like this
```
0:00-1:00
1:00-2:00
2:00-3:00
```

Then, run the program and it will ask you for the splits file and the unsplit audio file. It will also ask you for a prefix to use for the renamed files
